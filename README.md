# K-OS ![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/khoek/k-os/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

A UNIX-like operating system written by Keeley Hoek as a hobby. It was inspired by Hailey Somerville's [JSOS](https://github.com/charliesome/JSOS).

K-OS is a C kernel, with the exception of the required architecture-specific assembly code.

## Features

* Multiprocessor support
* Multitasking scheduler subsystem, C signals, POSIX system calls
* Userspace: Newlib port to K-OS, auto-builds `bash` and `coreutils`
* Memory Managment subsystem: Page Frame Allocator/Cache Allocator/Page Mapping Manipulation
* Drivers: PCI/SATA/PATA/Keyboard/E1000 (Intel 825xx) Ethernet Driver/PIT
* Disk/Filesystem subsystem: Disk label support (MSDOS, GPT)/Partition support (FAT32)
* Network subsystem: DHCP support and 4 layer packet switch
     * Link layer (Ethernet)
     * Network layer (IP, ARP)
     * Transport layer (TCP, UDP)
     * Application layer (ICMP, NBNS)
* Device subsystem: Unified Bus, Device and Driver APIs
* Time subsystem: Clock and Timer APIs
* Multiboot 1 compliant
* Misc: Profiler, SysRq support

## Compiling

The build system is handwritten, and fetches and builds the entire toolchain for you. Just run `make` in the project root directory to fetch and build everything (parallel builds with `make -j 8` are much faster and fine). The build system will prompt you when you don't have required utilities (like bison, or flex) installed or they can't be found. A burnable ISO will be emitted as (by default) `dist/image/package/cdrom.iso`.

To run/test the kernel in a QEMU virtual machine use `make run` in the project root directory (something like `apt install qemu-system-x86`, in order to provide `qemu-system-i586` is required).

### Configuration options
Currently K-OS accepts the following optional configuration options:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGCHECKS</td>
        <td>Compile system-wide bugchecks into the kernel, and other debugging information.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CONFIG_DEBUG_MM</td>
        <td>Enable particularly expensive MM-related bugchecks.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

To enable/disable these options edit the "kernel/config.h" file.
